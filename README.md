## **Introduction**  
In today’s data-driven world, businesses rely heavily on analytics to make informed decisions. The food delivery and restaurant industry is no exception. Zomato, one of the leading food delivery and restaurant discovery platforms, generates vast amounts of data daily. Analyzing this data can provide valuable insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, market trends, and operational efficiency.  

The **Zomato Insights Dashboard** is a **Power BI**-based analytical tool designed to visualize and interpret key metrics from Zomato’s dataset.
